Leaving port 22 open for public access is a major vulnerability. AWS Systems Manager is an option for a secure access to the EC2 instance, but arguably having immutable instances and avoiding logging in the instance is the best approach.
Using security groups only specific whitelisted IP addresses should be able to SSH into the EC2 instance.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
In the case of compromised API credentials, client-side encryption might be useful. This way even if a file is downloaded by an attacker, they won't be able to decrypt it.
