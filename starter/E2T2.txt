Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

The applications serves HTTP requests. Ideally, HTTPS should be used and redirection rule should be added to the application load balancer. This is why I have `securityhub-alb-http-to-https-redirection-check-cecaf35f` noncompliant rule in AWS Config
The S3 buckets are not compliant according to AWS Config. For example, server side encryption is not enabled for both the free and secret recipes. It is considered to be a best practice to have it enabled for all data stored in AWS. Moreover all public access should be blocked.
The EC2 instance has public IP. Since it is behind an application load balancer, it doesn't make sense to expose it to the outside world. As I previously mentioned, it is better to have the EC2 instance in a private subnet.
The EC2 instance has a reachable port range of 0-65535. This can be remediated by modifying ACLs or security groups.
